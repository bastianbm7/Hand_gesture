# Sign Language Prediction Model using YoloV8 and OpenCV.

This project involves the implementation of a real-time sign language detection model using the YOLOv8 pretrained model. The project's primary objective is to develop a model capable of predicting 9 letters of sign language based on this pretrained model.

To facilitate data acquisition, a concise code snippet for capturing and saving photos in a designated directory is employed. The training process takes place in Google Colab through Roboflow.

Furthermore, it offers a user-friendly experience through the integration of the OpenCV2 library in Python 3.10 for real-time monitoring of hand and body detection.

**The letters detected are**: - A - B - C- D - F - U - V - Y- Rock

**Total dataset contains 180 images, 20 from each letter**.
